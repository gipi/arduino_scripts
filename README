Scripts used to program Arduino without using the IDE

== DEPENDENCIES ==

 # apt-get install arduino-core


== WRITING NEW SKETCH ==

Every Sketch needs a dedicated working directory!

Exists only one Makefile containing the parameters for a 
correct compilation (the TARGET is generated based on the
sketch's containing directory).

The Makefile must be modified according the Arduino's hw owned
(See utility/boards.txt)

In order to compile a program you have to do the following

    $ cd myproject
    $ make -f ../Makefile upload


== ARDUINO SYNTAX ON VIM==

mkdir -p ~/.vim/syntax/
cp utility/arduino.vim ~/.vim/syntax/
echo "autocmd! BufNewFile,BufRead *.pde setlocal ft=arduino" >> ~/.vimrc

== HANDLE SERIAL ==

PySerial is a python module that can be used in order to handle serial port
like that Arduino give to you; it is possible to call the miniterm program
with the following

    $ python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyACM0

For more information see <http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/examples.html#miniterm>.
